  <h3>Privacy-Preserving Governance Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>Revolutionizing DAO voting with zero-knowledge proofs</p>
</div>

## Overview

zkVote is a next-generation privacy-preserving voting protocol designed specifically for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain governance systems. Leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, zkVote enables fully confidential voting while maintaining verifiable results and transparent governance processes.

**Current Status:** Pre-production (May 2025)

## üåü Key Features

- **Complete Ballot Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure vote privacy while maintaining verifiable results
- **Private Delegation**: Delegate voting power without revealing relationships
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Unified governance processes across multiple blockchain networks
- **Configurable Trust Models**: Balance security and user experience based on your requirements
- **Turn-key Integration**: Seamless integration with major DAO frameworks
- **Scalable Implementation**: Optimized zero-knowledge proofs for governance at any scale

## üìä Market Opportunity

- **12,000+** active DAOs managing $25B+ in treasury assets
- **500+** protocols with on-chain governance mechanisms
- **150+** multi-chain organizations requiring unified governance
- **Growing concerns** about vote buying, coercion, and governance attacks

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

zkVote employs a layered architecture:

- **Core Protocol Layer**: Zero-knowledge proof system optimized for voting operations
